     I had always loved programming as a kid, but back then I was programming in basic. I have two older brothers who were and are still programmers, so I’ve been surrounded by it my whole life. As I got older I got into construction and have been doing that since I was 21. As the internet came out and html was the big thing, I had always wanted to get back into it, to learn the behind the scenes workings of how it all happens. As they say, there’s no better time than now, so here I am, learning ruby and hope to develop some life changing programming that will help the whole of mankind. It may seem lofty, but why aim low?
